# Introduction

Finding a hospital during emergecnies can be very hectic especially when in a fairly new area, even in your own country. The need for this application came about when I was was in a similar situation and Google wasn't the best way but eventually I got to a healthy facility but this took a while. 

After this, I therefore, choose to develop a way by which one could find the nearest medical or health facility within one's location. This created Hospital Locator.

# How Hospital Locator Works

To get the available hospital facilities within one's area. you simply have to search your location and the results will be a list of all medical facilities within the region in Kenya.

# Check Out the Live Application!

The app does not require any form of login making it much more accessible to anyone at anytime.

Currently, I am testing the application by hosting it on Cyclic since Heroku announces their plans to drop their free hosting.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, [Code For Africa](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/HealthTools.API)



## Optimizations

I have added a lot of features to this over time, especially with the code formatting. Initially, I had all back-end operations within a single file but I changed this after getting a good command of the MVC structure!!!

Getting the right information for the project was quite the challenge but after extensive brainstorming and research, I found [Code For Africa](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/HealthTools.API) which has a range of APIs built with various African facts and information.

In my case, I settled for their health tools API which allowed me to fetch the data and further break it down to my needed structural objects.



## Lessons Learned:

Every project is a lesson learned in CSS! Still need work to work on this though

I also became more comfortable with navigating MVC architecture. 

## Future Improvements:

Currently this project is still with bugs.

I plan to restructure the API accessibility because it breaks occassion while works fully when run locally.

I need to improve on the UI and make it more presentable.

Plan to make the page more responsive for a range of devices.

I will need to get more APIs to include other countries since the concept can actually be used in many countries beyond Kenya.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute to the project by creating a new branch and forwarding the PR on any element of the project, I will gladly include any positive and helpful feature for the project.
